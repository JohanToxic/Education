# Litium Developer Education

The developer education can be done as a self study course or by attending scheduled or on-demand classroom training.

The scheduled classroom training is avaliable at https://www.litium.se/utbildning.

## Self study - Getting started

Go through the edcucation slides at https://litiumdev-slides-7.svc.litiumlab.se/ (the slides are hosted [here on GitHub](./Presentation) so if you find anything that needs to be fixed please create an Issue or submit a pull request).

Do the development tasks below when they are referenced in the slides and if you have questions please ask them in [Litium forum](https://forum.litium.com/).

### Development tasks

To practice what you learn from the slides you can do these tasks to create a simple bookstore.

Before you start with the tasks make sure that you have gone through [Litium system requirements](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/system-requirements). 

Some tasks assume that a previous task has been completed (task dependencies are presented in each tasks README-file), the recommended order to do them are:

1. [Installation](./Tasks/Installation)
1. [Author page](./Tasks/Author%20page)
1. [Author service](./Tasks/Author%20service)
1. [Author service decorator](./Tasks/Author%20service%20decorator)
1. [Pricing rules](./Tasks/Pricing%20rules)
1. [Author field](./Tasks/Author%20field)
1. [Validation](./Tasks/Validation)
1. [Web API](./Tasks/Web%20API)

#### Optional tasks

Below tasks might not be completed during classroom education but it is recommended that these are still completed as self study to get a deeper knowledge of Litium development.

1. [Move database to SQL Server](./Tasks/Move%20database%20to%20SQL%20Server)
1. [Move site to IIS](./Tasks/Move%20site%20to%20IIS)
1. [Docker](./Tasks/Docker)
1. [Redis](./Tasks/Redis)
1. [Enable Elasticsearch](./Tasks/Enable%20Elasticsearch)
1. [Kibana](./Tasks/Kibana)
1. [Data service](./Tasks/Data%20service)
1. [Integration kit](./Tasks/Integration%20kit)
1. [Test project](./Tasks/Test%20project)
1. [Author block](./Tasks/Author%20block)
1. [React](./Tasks/React)

#### Task archive

The tasks below cover functionality which is no longer in the platform and therefore no longer covered in the developer education.

1. [Lucene.Net search (removed in Litium 7.4)](./Tasks/Lucene.Net%20search)
