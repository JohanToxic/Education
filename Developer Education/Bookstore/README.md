# Bookstore

During Litium developer education we are creating a webshop for books.

Before you start make sure that you have gone through [Litium system requirements](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/system-requirements).

If you came here to learn Litium by self study just go through the tasks and if you have questions please ask them in [Litium forum](https://forum.litium.com/). 

Some tasks assume that a previous task has been completed, the recommended order to do them are:

1. [Author page](./Author%20page)
1. [Author block](./Author%20block)
1. [Author service](./Author%20service)
